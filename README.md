‚ö°Ô∏è AI-Powered E-commerce Recommender System

This project implements a personalized product recommendation API using FastAPI. It leverages a lightweight SQLite database for persistent storage of product catalogs and user behavior logs, allowing the system to generate recommendations either from newly uploaded CSV files or existing stored data. Each recommendation is enhanced with a real-time justification generated by the Gemini LLM.

Architecture
Frontend: A single index.html file using Tailwind CSS for a responsive user interface.

Backend: A FastAPI application (recommender_backend.py) that handles file uploads, data persistence (via SQLAlchemy/SQLite), heuristic scoring, and preparation of LLM prompt payloads.

Database: Serverless data persistence provided by SQLite via SQLAlchemy (recommender.db).

üöÄ Setup and Running
1. Prerequisites
You must have Python 3.8+ installed.

2. Install Dependencies
You need to install the libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the FastAPI Server
Navigate to the directory containing recommender_backend.py and run the server using Uvicorn. The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

uvicorn recommender_backend:app --reload

üõ†Ô∏è Usage Instructions
1. Data Structure
The system requires two CSV files:

Note: The system automatically handles header cleaning (e.g., converting Product ID to product_id).

2. Using the Dashboard (index.html)
Open index.html in your web browser.

To Upload Data: Select both the Product Catalog CSV and the User Behavior Log CSV under "1. Data Management" and enter a Target User ID. Submitting will overwrite the existing database tables.

To Get Recommendations from Database: Leave both file inputs empty, enter a Target User ID that exists in the database, and click the submit button.

The system will fetch the user's aggregated context from the database and display personalized product recommendations, each with an AI-generated rationale.
